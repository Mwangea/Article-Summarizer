# Article-Summarizer
An article summarizer tool that uses natural language processing to condense lengthy articles into short summaries. Upload your article and get a concise summary in seconds. Available on GitHub.
An article summarizer is a program that can automatically generate a condensed version of a longer text, such as a news article or research paper. The summarizer uses natural language processing techniques to identify the most important information and key points in the original text, and then presents them in a concise and readable format. By using an article summarizer, readers can quickly get an overview of the content of a longer text, without having to spend time reading the entire article. This can be useful for people who need to keep up with a large volume of information, or who want to get a sense of the main ideas of an article before deciding whether to read it in full. Uploading an article summarizer to GitHub can make it easier for other developers to access and use the program, and can also provide a platform for collaboration and improvement
